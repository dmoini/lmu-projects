# Projects
Example projects from my courses at Loyola Marymount University.

- **CMSI 186: Programming Lab**: Programming workshop where I completed projects including discrete simulation, randomized estimation, maze solving, dynamic programming, large-number arithmetic, and numerical methods. All projects coded in Java.
- **CMSI 281: Data Structures**: Introduction to data types, information structures, and algorithms. All projects coded in Java.
- **CMSI 282: Algorithms**: Continuation of exploration of algorithms. All projects coded in Java.
- **CMSI 284: Computer Systems Organization**: Introduction to the basic organization of computer systems. All projects coded in C.
- **CMSI 370: Interaction Design**: Introduction to interaction design and human-computer interaction, with equal emphasis on learning how to design and evaluate interaction architectures, and learning how to use existing frameworks to implement such architectures. All projects coded using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- **CMSI 386: Programming Languages**: Exploration of various programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Haskell, and TypeScript.
- **CMSI 485: Artificial Intelligence**: Introduction to the fundamental concepts needed to attain human-level intelligence in computer systems. All projects coded in Python.
