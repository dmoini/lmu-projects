- **[CMSI 299 Algorithms Laboratory](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi299-algorithms-laboratory)**: Independent study where I learned, practiced, and coded various algorithm implementations. Practice problems were found at [UVa Online Judge](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/). All problems coded in Python. 
- **[CMSI 355 Computer Networks](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi355-computer-networks)**: A detailed study of the design and use of internetworking technologies in modern digital communication systems. Projects coded in Java, Python, and JavaScript.
- **[CMSI 370 Interaction Design](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi370-interaction-design/)**: Introduction to interaction design and human-computer interaction, with equal emphasis on learning how to design and evaluate interaction architectures, and learning how to use existing frameworks to implement such architectures. All projects coded using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- **[CMSI 371 Computer Graphics](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi371-computer-graphics)**: Introduction to interactive computer graphics. Topics included the design and use of three-dimensional graphics engines and APIs, animation, physics and computer games, modeling, computational geometry, shading, ray tracing, and fractal geometry. All projects coded in C++ and used GLUT and OpenGL libraries.
- **[CMSI 386 Programming Languages](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi386-programming-languages/)**: Exploration of various programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Haskell, and TypeScript.
- **[CMSI 387 Operating Systems](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi387-operating-systems)**: Learned about concepts in the design of operating systems, including processes, process management, mutual exclusion, synchronization and message-passing, primary memory management, multiprogramming, paged allocation and paging policies, resource and I/O management, file systems, and security. Problems coded in C, Java, Python.
- **[CMSI 485 Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi485-artificial-intelligence/)**: Introduction to the fundamental concepts needed to attain human-level intelligence in computer systems. All projects coded in Python.
- **[CMSI 488 Language Translation and Implementation](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi488-language-translation-and-implementation)**: Introduction to the theory and design of translators and interpreters for high-level computer programming languages. Topics include programming language specification, scanner construction, parser construction, intermediate representations, virtual machines, code generation, and optimization. All projects coded in JavaScript.

## Projects

- **[Casper](https://github.com/dmoini/casper)**: Collaborated with four other LMU students to create Casper: The Friendly Programming Language. Casper incorporates a speech-like, easy-to-use syntax that eliminates unnecessary verboseness from the programming experience. Casper is reminiscent of Python with nuanced features and syntax designed to make its meaning as transparent as possible and make programming an entirely pleasant affair.
- **[Fortnite Stat Tracker](https://github.com/dmoini/fortnite-stat-tracker)**: Fortnite web application that retrieves player stats, daily shop items, and weekly challenges. Coded with HTML, JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, and [Fortnite API](https://fortniteapi.com/).
- **[Hog](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi387-operating-systems/blob/2ba22eab1fa4b967d68d313df931e8e944aad30a/Semester%20Project/hog.c)**: Created utility function that outputs which PIDs are using up the most CPU% on your machine.
- **[MAGIS Service Organization Website](https://github.com/danicobryan/magis)**: Helped maintain the official website for MAGIS Service Organization at LMU. The site serves as a platform for anyone interested in applying to learn more, wishing to partner with us to find more information, or wanting to check out what we are all about and keep updated. Coded with HTML, JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, and Instagram API.
- **[Personal Portfolio Website](https://dmoini.github.io/)**: Created a personal portfolio website to better share my projects and experiences. Coded with HTML, JavaScript/jQuery, CSS, and Bootstrap.
