## Projects

- **Amplify**: Collaborated with four other LMU students as the backend lead to create Amplify. Amplify is a community music streaming service that allows users to create and join rooms that host public music playlists using Spotify and YouTube services. Users can join rooms and add songs of their choice to the community queue, which will be cycled through in round-robin style between all users’ queued songs. Coded in **JavaScript**, **React Native**, and **TypeScript** and uses **Apollo GraphQL**, **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon API Gateway**, **Amazon DynamoDB**, and **[Serverless](https://serverless.com/)**. Amplify can be downloaded on the [Apple App Store](TODO).
- **CampusGANDR**: Collaborated with seven other LMU students and the LMU Psychology department as a backend developer on the admin panel. CampusGANDR embeds Personalized Normative Feedback(PNF) in a gamified mobile application to reduce defensiveness and reactance. These results will be presented in a game-like fashion so users can learn along with fellow classmates, discover more aspects of campus life, interact with their peers in a friendly environment, and size up the competition to become the top GANDRer. coded in TypeScript, JavaScript and React and uses Google Firebase.
- **[Casper](https://github.com/dmoini/casper)**: Collaborated with four other LMU students to create Casper: The Friendly Programming Language. Casper incorporates a speech-like, easy-to-use syntax that eliminates unnecessary verboseness from the programming experience. Casper is reminiscent of Python with nuanced features and syntax designed to make its meaning as transparent as possible and make programming an entirely pleasant affair. Coded in **​JavaScript​** and uses **[​Ohm​](https://github.com/harc/ohm)** and **​Jest**.
- **[Fortnite Stat Tracker](https://github.com/dmoini/fortnite-stat-tracker)**: Fortnite web application that retrieves player stats, daily shop items, and weekly challenges. Coded in **HTML**, **JavaScript/jQuery**, and **CSS** and used **Bootstrap** and [Fortnite API](https://fortniteapi.com/).
- **[Hog](https://github.com/dmoini/cmsi387-operating-systems/blob/2ba22eab1fa4b967d68d313df931e8e944aad30a/Semester%20Project/hog.c)**: Created utility function that outputs which process IDs are using up the most CPU percentage on your machine. coded in **C**.
- **[MAGIS Service Organization Website](https://github.com/danicobryan/magis)**: Helped maintain the official website for MAGIS Service Organization at LMU. The site serves as a platform for anyone interested in applying to learn more, wishing to partner with us to find more information, or wanting to check out what we are all about and keep updated. Coded in **HTML**, **JavaScript/jQuery**, **CSS** and used **Bootstrap** and **Instagram API**.
- **[Personal Portfolio Website](https://dmoini.github.io/)**: Created a personal portfolio website to better share my projects and experiences. Coded in **HTML**, **JavaScript/jQuery**, and **CSS** and used **Bootstrap**.
- **[Playroll](http://join.playroll.io/)**: Playroll is an application that allows users to create playrolls, which replace the traditional idea of playlists. Using a set of unique algorithms, Playroll uses your provided music to create the perfect playlist. Worked on the backend using **Go**, **GORM**, **GraphQL**, and **PostgresDB**. Playroll can be downloaded on the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/playroll/id1457282211) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playroll.playroll&hl=en_US).
